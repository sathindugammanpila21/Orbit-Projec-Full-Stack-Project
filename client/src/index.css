  This rule targets native <button> elements but excludes Ant Design buttons.
  It removes the default browser background and border, allowing Tailwind classes to work as expected.
*/
/* 
  This rule now specifically targets the simple text-like buttons in the app 
  (e.g., 'Back to Projects', tab navigation) to make them transparent, 
  without interfering with styled buttons in forms or modals.
*/
/* 
  This rule now targets any button with a Tailwind hover class (e.g., hover:bg-slate-100).
  This makes all simple, text-like buttons transparent by default, while leaving
  explicitly styled buttons (like the main submit button) unaffected.

  REMOVED RULES
================================================================================
The following overly-broad rules were removed because their use of "!important"
was preventing your modern Tailwind CSS styles from working.

button {
  height: 40px !important;
  border-radius: 0 !important;
  box-shadow: none !important;
}

input , select{
  height: 40px !important;
  border-radius: 0 !important;
  border: 1px solid #bbbbbb !important;
  width: 100% !important;
  padding-left: 15px !important;
}

textarea{
  border-radius: 0 !important;
  border: 1px solid #bbbbbb !important;
}

input:focus , textarea:focus , select:focus {
  box-shadow: none !important;
  border: 1px solid #343434 !important;
}

table{
  border: 1px solid #bbbbbb !important;
}
